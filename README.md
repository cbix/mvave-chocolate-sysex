## SysEx dumps

The ultimate goal is to create an open source configuration tool, but one may already use these SysEx commands to change the basic controller mode, e.g. using `aseqsend`:

```
~$ aseqsend -l
 Port    Client name                      Port name
 40:0    SINCO                            SINCO MIDI 1
129:0    FootCtrl                         FootCtrl Bluetooth
~$ aseqsend -p 40:0 "F0 00 32 09 49 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 0B 5E 03 F7" # switch to "Program change C" mode
~$ aseqsend -p 40:0 "F0 00 32 09 49 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 06 68 03 F7" # switch to "Manufacturer control" mode
```

Observations:

- configuration using aseqsend only worked while the official app is running and connected (runs under Wine), it seems the device only accepts SysEx within an enclosed USB Request Block
- SysEx towards BLE MIDI didn't work, likely requires debugging the official Android app
